  "riskAndAchievmentModalText": "Risk Scores span from 0 (higher risk) to 100 (lower risk) and indicate how likely it is that an organization will experience a cyber attack or other online security threat. The Risk Score is primarily based on factors such as the count and severity of your active security findings. Your Risk Score may change over time as new security findings are discovered and older risks are remediated. With Cyfax, a higher achievement fill on the bar represents a lower risk and better security posture, providing a clear visual of your organization's cyber hygiene.",
